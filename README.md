# UCB-SQL-Project

## Exploring employee database with SQL

### Overview of Project
I used SQL to explore and manipulate data. In this challenege I determined:

  -   Number of retiring employees per title
  -   identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
  -   Prepare the manager for the "silver tsunami"The total number of votes

### Results
  1. The number of retiring emplyees by title

     - as we can see in the picture above that maximum number of employees tiring are engineers followed by senior staff.  
      
     - There are only 6 managers retiring 
  
  2.  The employees eligible for the mentorship program

     - Most retiring employees eligible for mentorship progam are with the title of senior staff (~412)  and least have title of assistant engineers. 
      - None of the mangares are eligible for mentorship program.
